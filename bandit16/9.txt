1️⃣ $     echo |
openssl s_client waits for input (it expects you to type something).
So:
        ➡ Sends a blank input immediately
        ➡ Prevents openssl from waiting forever

2️⃣ $   timeout 1 COMMAND

➡ Runs COMMAND
➡ Kills it after 1 second
➡ Some ports are open but don’t respond or hang during SSL handshake that Why needed here?


3️⃣ 2>/dev/null
1> → stdout (normal output)
2> → stderr (errors)
Throw away all error messages -> 🧠 Keeps output clean so grep works reliably


4️⃣-q  → quiet mode
