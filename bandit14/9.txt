🔑 This teaches:

1. What localhost means
2. What a port is


1️⃣ What localhost means
localhost means “this same computer”
localhost                               → IP address 127.0.0.1    +    It never leaves your machine   +    No internet involved


Your computer
 ├── CPU
 ├── Memory
 ├── Disk
 └── Network stack
      └── 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

When you connect to localhost, you’re talking to your own machine, just through the network system.




2️⃣ What a port is
A port is a number that identifies which program you want to talk to.

IP = which computer
Port = which program on that computer

IP address  → Building address
Port number → Apartment number
“Apartment 30000 in this building”




why we need localhost
localhost exists so programs on the same machine can talk to each other safely, fast, and without the internet ?
