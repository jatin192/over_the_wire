Dot not try to remember 200 commands from a cheat-sheet. That's not learning. That's a cyber self-harm
Do not copy-paste random scripts from reddit. That's not HACKING


Why bother with all this pain? Why no just stick to windows or macos and call it a day?
Because Linux is the foundation or literally everything in HACKING. 
Every 
pentesting tool,
every CTF,
every web server,
every shell
-Linux is the default


They run $namp like its a prayer
They wrtie Bash scripts that look like spells.

You did'nt just learn Linux. You became Linux


Play,break,fix,repeat  -Terminal

Linux is not design for convenience But for control
