________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1️⃣  What $0 REALLY means
    ➡️  $0 is the name/path of the currently running program (shell or script)
    ➡️  $0 is identity, not location.
    ➡️  It is set by the OS when the process starts, not by you.
    ➡️  $0 always shows who is currently running, not who started the process
    ➡️  $0 does not return ./uppershell because uppershell has already been replaced by /bin/sh before you ever typed $0 



2️⃣ Why $0 worked in Bandit32

Bandit32 uses a restricted wrapper shell that Converts all input to UPPERCASE it treat ls as LS before execution
Execution flow:
User input     → $0
Uppercase step → $0 (unchanged)
Expansion      → /bin/sh
Execution      → exec /bin/sh

🔥 Result: real shell spawned



🧠 One-line memory rule 
$0 works because it reveals and re-executes the real shell already running, bypassing superficial restrictions.
$0 might be ❌ Dangerous if used in SUID programs & Used in sandboxes or executed blindly


🏁 Final memory sentence
$0 always shows who is currently running, not who started the process
