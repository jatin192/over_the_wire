# OverTheWire
OverTheWire Bandit is a well-known CTF-style wargame focused on Linux and system 
security concepts. This repository contains structured notes and explanations 
based on my solutions.

Readers are encouraged to attempt each challenge independently before referring 
to these notes, as the learning value lies in the problem-solving process.
