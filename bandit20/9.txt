Step 1  --> Hacker : “I’ll stand here and wait”
            $   nc -l localhot 1234

Step 2  --> powerful program : “I need a service on localhost, let me connect”
            $   ./suconnect 1234

Step 3  --> The powerful program asks:
            $   “What is the password?”

Step 4  You answer correctly

➡️ You never attacked it
➡️ It came to you

| Thing             | Role   | Why            |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| `nc -l`           | Server | It waits       |
| `suconnect`       | Client | It connects    |
| bandit20 password | Proof  | Identity check |
| bandit21 password | Reward | Access         |

🔹 Two different roles in networking

_______________nc -l 127.0.0.1 1234_________________vs__________________nc localhost 1234______________________

Command_________________________Role_____________________________Meaning_______________________________________
|                       |                              |
| nc -l 127.0.0.1 1234	|       Server (listener)	   |        “Wait for someone to connect to me”
| ______________________|______________________________|________________________________________________________
| nc localhost 1234	    |       Client	               |        “Connect to a server already listening”  
|_______________________|______________________________|________________________________________________________



🔹 127.0.0.1                =   this same machine
🔹 Command-line argument    =   input you pass to a program
🔹 nc -l 127.0.0.1 1234     =   nc -l localhost 1234

➡️“Localhost is safe” is a false assumption ❌


❌ “I am the attacker → I connect to a powerful service → I steal data”
✅ “I wait → the powerful program connects to ME”

⚠️ Why this is EXTREMELY dangerous
❌ Wrong assumption made by the program
The program assumes:“If I connect to localhost, it must be safe”



nc -l localhost 1234                        # Server (listener) 
                                            # localhost/127.0.0.1 both are same
                                            # -l → listen



./suconnect 1234                            # Client 
                                                               # Connect to a server already listening 



 nc -l localhost 1234                        #  Server (listener) 
                                                                #  localhost/127.0.0.1 both are same
                                                                #  -l → listen

1️⃣ Facebook login (NORMAL case – what you already know)

Roles👉
You (browser)   →   client
Facebook        →   server

Flow 👉
You connect to Facebook
Facebook says: “Enter your password”
You type your FB password
Password goes to Facebook
Facebook verifies
Facebook gives access (session / cookie)

✅ Password goes client → server
✅ Server recognizes you

2️⃣ Bandit Level 20 (DIFFERENT but REAL model)
Roles
suconnect   →   client (it connects)
nc -l       →   server (it waits)

Now here is the key difference 👇

🔑 WHO is being authenticated?
Facebook:   👉 User is being authenticated
Bandit:     👉 The thing suconnect connects to is being authenticated

That’s it.
This single sentence removes all confusion.
