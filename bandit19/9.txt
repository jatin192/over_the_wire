setuid
👉 When a program is executed, it runs with the permissions of the file’s owner instead of the user who ran it
   Owner   = bandit20
   You     = bandit19

Privilege Escalation
👉 A program runs with more permissions than the user who started it

Uncontrolled Privilege Escalation (BAD 🚨)
👉 This is a vulnerability

Controlled Privilege Escalation (GOOD ✅)
👉The system allows a user to temporarily gain higher privileges for a specific task only


🧠 setuid allows a program to run with the permissions of its owner, enabling controlled privilege escalation for specific tasks

./ = run this executable from the current directory
